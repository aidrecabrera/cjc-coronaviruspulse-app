Unfortunately, myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination was an unanticipated adverse event. In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Ryan Ruiyang Ling and colleagues commendably review the risk of this adverse event in the context of risk after other vaccines. Their study provides an important perspective on the historical global experience with cardiac adverse events after vaccination.",
